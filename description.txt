npm install -g gatsby@2.4.17

gatsby new gatsby-bootcamp https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world



there are 6 default scripts and 
development script -> for starting development server and live reload 

gatsby-plugin-sass - plugin for sass
npm install gatsby-plugin-sass node-sass
npm run develop

graphiQl
http://localhost:8000/___graphql


now we have alos graphqlplaygorund that gatsby supports

we need to set up the environment varaible on our machine for graphqlplay-ground to work

we can set it inot the package.json (script section) file -prolem-> it's not cross os compitable, so we will create seperate file for 
setting env varaible which is very common approch.

root of the project .env.development -> key = value

GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE = playgorund -this will give us new tool in browser

only thing we need to do load this file in when we using development server -> to do that we use very popular env cmd npm package

npm install --save-dev env-cmd

after this we need to change develop script it's gone use env-cmd to load that env variable file in then it will run gatsby develop

"develop" : "env-cmd .env.development gatsby develop"

source-filesystem -> gatsby-source-filesystem -> link : https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=source-filesystem
this plugin allow us to pull those mark-down file to gatsby then we will use another pulugin to convert mark down to the html

we need to update config(gatsby-config)

{
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: 'src',
        path:`${__dirname}/src/`
      }
},

run again npm run develop and you will find two more function of graphql 
1.file ->
2.allFile -> 

query{
  allFile{
    edges{
      node{
        name
        extension
        dir
      }
    }
  }
}

run this query in browser graphiQl editor you will get all the file which resides in src folder

-->

what we want ?

we need to render data from .md file (transform markdown file into html);

so our target is to fetch only markdown file and parse that mark down file into the content that is useful

for that we need another plugin that pairs wth gatsby source filesystem plugin

new plugin is going to look for markdown files in their and parse them inot usefull data

plugin name -> gatsby-transformer-remark -> npm install gatsby-transformer-remark@2.3.8

remark is a stand alone javascript library for parsing markdown files -> this plugin run the (remark library) behind the seen

add new item into plugin array in config file {
    gatsby-transformer-remark
}


run again npm run develop and you will find two more function of graphql 
1.markdownRemarks - fetching individual post
2.allMarkdownRemarks- fetchiing all posts
